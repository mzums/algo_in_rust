# Algo in Rust

![alt text](image.png)

## What does this repo contain?
Various algorithms written in Rust. Useful when learning competitive programming or basics of Rust.
- ### **Red Black Tree**
    It's a **self-balancing binary search tree** where each node has an additional color property (red or black) to ensure that the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions. Its key properties include: every path from the root to a null pointer has the same number of black nodes, and no two consecutive red nodes can exist, guaranteeing O(log‚Å°n) time for search, insertion, and deletion operations.

## Usage
- add a node  
    ```add <num>```
- remove a node  
    ```remove <num>```
- display tree   
    ```show```
- print height of the tree  
    ```height```
- print number of red nodes  
    ```red```
- quit program  
    ```quit```
